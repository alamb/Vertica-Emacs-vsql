Emacs VSQL mode

Instructions:
  Download vsql.el from github

  Add this to your .emacs file (pointing at wherever you downloaded
  vsql.el):

;; vsql specific emacs SQL mode: 
;; run via M-x sql-vertica 
(load â€œvsql") 

  Invoke the mode with M-x sql-vertica

Future work:
  Update the keywords list for the vertica specific dialect, and maybe
  other stuff. Feel free to help out!
